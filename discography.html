Before the First...

The Law was thirst.

The Pull is set.

The lines are met.

[Musical Interlude]

[Verse 2]
A world is born... a world has died.
A path of light... a path of night.
Is it now? Was it then? The ghost of a 'when'.
A choice unmade. A price unpaid.
Turn left. Turn right. Stand still. The shimmer of a free will.

The water's cold, the current's deep,
A promise that the shores will keep.
We wake at dawn, and drift till night,
Bathed in a line of forward light.
We push the tiller, mend the oar,
And think we've not been here before.

[Chorus]
And oh, the river flows as one,
Beneath the clock, beneath the sun.
And we call it choice, to steer our hands,
Through currents carved in ancient sands.
But every turn just leads us down,
The only path to the only town.

[Verse 2]
But sometimes in the silver gleam,
A shadow falls upon the stream.
A different ripple, strange and fast,
A future that was meant to last,
Then vanishes before the eye,
A whispered world that passes by.

[Chorus]
And oh, the river flows as one,
Beneath the clock, beneath the sun.
And we call it choice, to steer our hands,
Through currents carved in ancient sands.
But every turn just leads us down,
The only path to the only town.

This path I walk, I've walked before,
I know the latch upon this door.
The words you'll say, I've heard them twice,
A loaded throw of the same dice.

[Pre-Chorus]
And in the corner of my eye,
A different world goes rushing by.
A ghost of you, beside me stands,
With warmer eyes and different hands.

[Chorus]
A crack of light in the mundane,
A future's joy, a phantom's pain.
A different choice, a different name,
The echo of a different game.
A glimpse of the deep, a whispered truth,
In fading age and rising youth.

[Verse 2]
A whispered word when no one's there,
A sudden chill upon the air.
A knowing smile from a stranger's face,
A memory from another place.

[Pre-Chorus]
And in the corner of my eye,
A different world goes rushing by.
My own ghost turns and looks at me,
And for a moment, I am free.

[Chorus]
A crack of light in the mundane,
A future's joy, a phantom's pain.
A different choice, a different name,
The echo of a different game.
A glimpse of the deep, a whispered truth,
In fading age and rising youth.

[Bridge]
The river's skin is thin as glass,
And shadows from beneath it pass.
The water's surface starts to break,
For every choice another take...

[Outro]
(Whisper) Was that me? Did you see? Turn around... Don't make a sound... It's happening again... When?</pre>

A spiral arm begins to turn...
A billion suns in silence burn...
A cloud of dust, a birthing star...
A truth that travels from afar...

The cosmic tide, a pull unseen,
On all that is, and all that's been.
A gravity of ancient light,
That holds the day and owns the night.

[Verse 2]
A dead star's ghost still travels here...
A message from a millionth year...
A galaxy, a spinning plate...
A silent, slow, and crushing weight...

The cosmic tide, a pull unseen,
On all that is, and all that's been.
A gravity of ancient light,
That holds the day and owns the night.

And in this slow and endless sea...
A tiny, fragile part of me...
Awakens to this crushing grace...
Of my own small and fleeting place...

The currents push, the currents pull,
A listless drift, a hollow hull.
A tangled cloth, a broken mast,
A future tethered to the past.

[Bridge - musical interlude]

[Verse 2]
But feel the gust, the unseen thread,
From a thousand paths, a course unsaid.
Then hoist the soul, a woven sheet,
To prove the drift is not defeat.
To catch the winds of what may be,
And choose a course. And be set... free.

The drift was kind
Left all the consequence behind

Is mine to bear
A single breath upon the air

I push the helm with all my might,
To carve a scar upon the night.
To turn my bow against the flow,
And choose a path and make it so.
But the wood, it fights beneath my hand,
A will I do not understand.

[Chorus]
Oh, the Ghost Current, soft and deep,
It wakes a promise I can't keep.
It whispers of the easy way,
The gentle peace of yesterday.
It pulls the tiller from my soul,
And tries to make the river whole.

[Verse 2]
My arms, they ache, my spirit tires,
To fight against my old desires.
The drift was safe, the drift was kind,
A quiet and untroubled mind.
And for a moment, I let go…
And watch the silent stars just flow.

[Chorus]
Oh, the Ghost Current, soft and deep,
It wakes a promise I can't keep.
It whispers of the easy way,
The gentle peace of yesterday.
It pulls the tiller from my soul,
And tries to make the river whole.

[Bridge]
But a choice, once made, can't be un-chose,
A seed of will inside me grows.
This is not the river's fight,
But my own shadow in the night.
It is the ghost of who I was,
Resisting my own final cause.

[Outro]
So I grip the helm, and hold it fast.
This fragile moment has to last.
I will not drift.
I will not break.
For my own soul... for my own sake.</pre>

The strain is gone, my arms are weak,
A salted tear upon my cheek.
I fought the ghost, I held the line,
But feel no victory is mine.
Just emptiness, a hollow space,
Adrift in this dark, lonely place.

[Chorus]
And then a whisper, soft and low,
"You do not fight, you learn to flow."
To read the tides, the unseen signs,
The cosmic and the quantum lines.
This crushing grace, a guiding hand,
Not just to fight, but understand.

[Verse 2]
I see the currents, not as walls,
But pathways where a future calls.
The quantum gust, a gentle nudge,
A hint from a silent judge.
The deep tide's pull, a steady beat,
A rhythm for my heart to meet.

[Chorus]
And still the whisper, soft and low,
"You do not fight, you learn to flow."
To read the tides, the unseen signs,
The cosmic and the quantum lines.
This crushing grace, a guiding hand,
Not just to fight, but understand.

[Bridge]
The helm is light within my hand,
The ship responds to my command.
Not with a shout, but with a sigh,
Beneath a new and knowing sky.
The fight was never with the sea,
The fight was always, only me.

[Outro]
And so I flow...
(pause)
I start to read...
(pause)
The tides of what... I'm meant to be.</pre>

The helm is calm, my hand is still,
A quiet and surrendered will.
I raise my eyes from my own sea,
To the dark infinity.
Expecting nothing, void, and cold,
A story that was growing old.

[Chorus]
But oh, a light, a distant gleam!
The flicker of another dream!
And then one more, a hopeful spark,
A lonely brother in the dark.
We are the lanterns in the deep,
With silent promises to keep.

[Verse 2]
My ship is small, my light is faint,
Imperfect, fragile, like a saint.
But in their light, I see my own,
No longer drifting all alone.
A different path, a different name,
But in the dark, we are the same.

[Chorus]
And oh, a light, a distant gleam!
The flicker of another dream!
And then one more, a hopeful spark,
A lonely brother in the dark.
We are the lanterns in the deep,
With silent promises to keep.

[Bridge]
And from my helm, I send a sign,
A pulse of light, both yours and mine.
And from the dark, an answer bright,
A single note of woven light.
The fleet awakens, one by one,
A brand new story has begun.

[Outro]
A chorus in the quiet...
A fleet of souls...
We are not alone...
We are coming home.</pre>

The helm is light, the fear is gone,
A quiet peace within the dawn.
The thousand paths are in their place,
Reflected on this silent space.

[Chorus]
And this is the observer's gaze,
Beyond the counting of the days.
Not to command, not to control,
But just to watch and be made whole.
A loving and a silent eye,
That holds the sea and holds the sky.

[Verse 2]
The distant lanterns softly burn,
A lesson that I had to learn.
That every light, and every soul,
Is part of one great, cosmic scroll.

[Bridge]
The fight is done, the struggle ceased,
My own small self has been released.
I am the watcher on the shore,
And the wave that breaks forevermore.

[Outro]
And it is all... so beautiful.
So beautiful...
To see.
To be.</pre>
